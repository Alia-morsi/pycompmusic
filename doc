is top level function: 
creates AudioProcessor class, SpectrogramImage and WaveFormImage classes. 

class SpectrogramImage
self.y_bin - mapping from  y (image_height) to a tuple freq. bin (whole + mantisa part)
There are more pixels than freq. bins, right?

for given spectrum 
1) creates the pixels from the spectrum: 
calculates the color for each pixel in self.palette[palette_idx]
palette_idx is computed by interpolating current between whole part y_bin[0] and residual of next bin.

2) appends them to the image
